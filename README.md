This code checks if there is a previously recorded highest score in the browser's localStorage. If there isn't, it initiates the local storage with the value of zero and goes on incrementing with score increases. 
If there is, it retrieves the previous highest score and displays it on the web page, and increments only if current highest score greater than that of localStorage.

# Use localStorage
By using localStorage, the highest score will persist even if the user closes or refreshes the page, allowing the application to remember the highest score across sessions.
